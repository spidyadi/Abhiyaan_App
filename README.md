Why I want to work in the team:
------------------------------
I have always aspired to know the workings of a self driven car and I have been following closely the research and development of Google's and Uber's self-driven cars for the past two years
When I came to insti I wanted to take something away from insti which was not in the courses and I think this is a really good place to learn from.
